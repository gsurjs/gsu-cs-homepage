  <p><strong>Welcome Everyone!</strong><br>About Me:</p>



  <p>I'm currently working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at GSU's Collaborative Human AI Center while also serving as a Field Product Guide at Rivian. I love the challenge of turning complex ideas into practical solutions that actually make a difference!</p>

  <p>My research interests center on Human-Robot Interaction, VR/AR, Edge Computing, and building AI systems that people can trust. I'm particularly drawn to projects where cutting-edge technology meets real human needs.</p>

  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="SPOT Facial Recognition Model">

  <p>Spot: Cognitive Companion is an AI-powered robotic assistant designed to enhance human-robot interactions by integrating dynamic AI capabilities, user recognition, and environmental awareness. This project leverages facial recognition, large language models, and vision language models to create a more interactive and intelligent robotic assistant.</p>
